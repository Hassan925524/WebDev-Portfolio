        <h1>Projects I worked on</h1>
        <p> <h2>Personal Portfolio Website:</h2>
            "I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The website
            features an interactive design, responsive layout, and smooth navigation, built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I implemented a contact form that sends emails directly to my inbox using a PHP backend. This
            project helped me improve my front-end development skills and understand the basics of user experience
            design."</p>
        <p><h2>Weather Forecasting App:</h2>
            "I created a weather forecasting app that provides real-time weather updates for any location. Using the
            OpenWeatherMap API, I fetched data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, which were then
            displayed in a user-friendly interface built with React. This project enhanced my knowledge of API
            integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and state management in React."</p>
        <p><h2>Task Management System:</h2> 
            "I developed a task management system to help users organize their daily activities. The system includes
            features like task creation, categorization, due dates, and completion tracking. I used Node.js and Express
            for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Angular for the front-end interface. This project allowed me
            to practice full-stack development and understand the intricacies of RESTful API design."</p>
            <p><h2>Car Management System:</h2>
                " The car management system is a console-based Python application designed to efficiently manage a fleet of cars by allowing users to perform various operations such as adding new cars, updating car information, viewing detailed car records, and deleting entries. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing car attributes like make, model, year, and status (whether the car is available, rented, or under maintenance), helping users to keep track of the fleet's availability and operational condition with ease. Its an ideal solution for small rental companies or personal fleet management."</p>
